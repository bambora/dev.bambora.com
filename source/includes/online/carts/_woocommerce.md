## Settings
### Title
The name of the payment option. This is the name your customers will see at checkout. Example “Pay with Bambora Checkout”.

### Description
Include a short description of the payment method. Your customers will see this description at checkout.

### Merchant number
The merchant number you received from Bambora. You can find your merchant number in the <a href="https://merchant.bambora.com" target="_blank">Bambora Backoffice</a> via the menu **Settings** -> **<a href="https://merchant.bambora.com/merchantnumbers" target="_blank">Merchant numbers</a>**.
<br/>
Merchant numbers starting with a **T** are for testing and numbers starting with a **P** are for live (Production) use.

### Access token
The Access token is the username of an API user. Enter the Access token for your API user, found in the <a href="https://merchant.bambora.com" target="_blank">Bambora Backoffice</a> via the menu **Settings** -> **<a href="https://merchant.bambora.com/apiusers" target="_blank">API users</a>**. If you don’t have an API user, create one and take note of the Access token.

### Secret token
The Secret token is the password of an API user. This token is automatically generated when an API user is created and only displayed once at that time. Therefore you should take note of the Secret token when creating an API user. If you have lost the Secret token you will have to create a new API user in the <a href="https://merchant.bambora.com" target="_blank">Bambora Backoffice</a> via the menu **Settings** -> **<a href="https://merchant.bambora.com/apiusers" target="_blank">API users</a>** -> **Create API user**.

### Display window as
Choose how to display the payment window. Either as an **overlay** on top of your website or in **full screen**.

### Instant capture
Enable instant capture to capture the payment immediately. You may only use instant capture if your customers receive their products immediately, like digital goods as e-books and the like.
