# Point of Sale (POS)
A point of sale (POS) system allows you and your sub-merchants to take payments in-person. We call our POS system SproutPOS. We offer SDKs on Android and iOS which utilize the iCMP payment terminal by Ingenico to support swipe, chip and pin, NFC contactless on Visa, MasterCard and Interac debit cards
as well as Apple Pay.

## Integration Overview
To integrate you will need to download our SproutPOS EMV SDK. The SDK comes with a simulator so you can test different responses from the terminal without needing an actual point of sale terminal itself. When you are done testing, you can order a payment terminal from us and use the credit card in your wallet to test.
