# Point of Sale (POS)

A point of sale (POS) system allows you and your sub-merchants to take payments in-person. We call our POS system SproutPOS. We offer SDKs on Android and iOS which utilize the iCMP payment terminal by Ingenico to support swipe, chip and pin, NFC contactless on Visa, MasterCard and Interac debit cards
as well as Apple Pay.
