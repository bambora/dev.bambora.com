## Browser SDK
Our Browser SDK (Payfields) is a client-side JavaScript library that injects credit card input fields into your web page, and then formats and validates the user input. As we hosted the library, it limits the scope of your PCI compliance to SAQ-A by removing the need for your browser or server code to handle credit card information.

You can read the full documentation and the source [here](https://github.com/Beanstream/beanstream-payform).
