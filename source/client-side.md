#Overview

We provide several client-side tools that provide card tokenization along with making payments with that token. This means that you need minimal server-side code to take payments.



# Mobile SDKs

The Bambora mobile SDKs provide a means to collect the customer's credit card details. They also have the ability to process the payment for you. This does not require an API key and is performed directly in the app.

If you choose to just collect the token and then process the payment, then jump to our section on [server-side](/server-side.html) charges.

To process the payment in-app you can head to our tutorials for each SDK:

* [iOS](ios.html#making-payments) make payments
* [Android](/android.html#making-payments) make payments


# Checkout

You can also take payments directly in your website using Bambora Checkout. This solution handles all of the processing for you in the browser.

Here is the full guide for [making payments online with Checkout](/online.html#checkout).
