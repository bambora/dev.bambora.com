# Partner Quickstart

Welcome to our partner setup guide. Use this space to learn how to request your partner account, and how to test our Onboarding API.

This guide will show you how to create and configure a test account.

This guide builds on the [Merchant Quickstart Guide](../../merchant_quickstart/setup)

## 1. Request a partner account

You can request a partner account [here](/docs/forms/request_partner_account). You will be emailed an API key for our sandbox environment.
