# Partner Signup
A partner account will allow you access to our Back Office, our Partner APIs and our Merchant APIs (excluding Payments). We offer two types of partner accounts. Test accounts and Production accounts.

Both accounts work on our Production environment, but a test account will only work on the sandboxed onboarding API.

If you are accepted onto the Partner program you will be issued with a Test Account within 24 hours. You will be issued with a Production account when you are ready to go live.

## Signup Form
ToDo: Add form.
