# Merchant Signup
A Merchant account will allow you access to our Back Office and our Merchant APIs (including Payments). We offer two types of merchant accounts. Test accounts and Production accounts. Both accounts work on our Production environment, but a test account will never process real-world payments.

## Test Account
Test Accounts are immediately approved.

ToDo: Add form.

## Production Account
Production Accounts usually takes 48 hours to be approved. See [here](http://www.beanstream.com/boarding/) for more information on Merchant boarding, and [here](http://www.beanstream.com/pricing/) to signup for a Production Merchant account.
