# Welcome

Welcome to our setup and configuration guide. Use this space to learn how to create and configure your account, and how to test our APIs.

This guide will show you how to create and configure a test account.

## 1. Create a test account

You can create a test account <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.

## 2. Generate API keys

You will need a Merchant ID (MID) and an API key per API that you wish to test. Your MID can be found in the top-right corner of the screen after logging in to the [Back Office](https://www.beanstream.com/admin/).

You can generate five keys for our five APIs in our Back Office.

* **Payments API Key:** Navigate to `Administration > Account Settings > Order Settings` in the sidebar, then scroll to `Payment Gateway > Security/Authentication`. If the 'API Access Passcode' field is empty, you can generate a new key by clicking the 'Generate New Code' button, scrolling to the bottom of the screen and clicking the 'Update' button.

* **Recurring Billing API Key:** Navigate to `Administration > Account Settings > Order Settings` in the sidebar, then scroll to `Recurring Billing`. If the 'API Access Passcode' field is empty, you can generate a new key by clicking the 'Generate New Code' button, scrolling to the bottom of the screen and clicking the 'Update' button.

* **Reporting API Key:** Navigate to `Administration > Account Settings > Order Settings` in the sidebar, then scroll to `Reporting`. If the 'API Access Passcode' field is empty, you can generate a new key by clicking the 'Generate New Code' button, scrolling to the bottom of the screen and clicking the 'Update' button.

* **Batch File Upload (ACH/EFT Payments) API Key:** Navigate to `Administration > Account Settings > Order Settings` in the sidebar, then scroll to `Batch File Upload`. If the 'API Access Passcode' field is empty, you can generate a new key by clicking the 'Generate New Code' button, scrolling to the bottom of the screen and clicking the 'Update' button.

* **Payment Profile API Key:** Navigate to `Configuration > Payment Profile Configuration` in the sidebar, then scroll to `Security Settings`. If the 'API Access Passcode' field is empty, you can generate a new key by clicking the 'Generate New Code' button, scrolling to the bottom of the screen and clicking the 'Update' button.

## 3. Configure the security settings

A test account comes with default security settings. You should take a moment to familiarize yourself with these before you begin.
