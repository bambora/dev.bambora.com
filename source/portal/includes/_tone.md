# Tone

The tone you use while writing documentation is important. The documentation represents the company, so maintaining quality and and consistency is as valued as the amount of documentation available.

Here are some notes on Tone from the official Bambora Brand and Design Guide.

## Voice

The voice of Bambora is filled with compassion, invoking a sense of humility in every conversation. The personalities behind the brand understand the big picture: humans drive business, not payments or payment products. 

The voice of Bambora conveys a quiet confidence; self-assured and soft spoken. Like a curious neighbor, Bambora respects boundaries but doesn’t shy away from conversation, or an opportunity to share a story. 

Bambora speaks like a human, of course. The brand owns up when it makes a mistake and listens carefully when others are speaking — interrupting is so rude, right? Oh yeah, the brand is always asking questions; always excited to learn something new. 

To keep things simple, Bambora follows a few guidelines when writing — nothing special, just good communication. But when it comes to something serious, Bambora cuts to the chase; there’s no room for small talk when a customer needs help.
