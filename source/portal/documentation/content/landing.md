# Landing Page Template

The landing page is the front of the dev portal. It has no navigation menu so it must be especially skilled at directing users to the products and information they need.

The landing page is NOT for marketing content. Ditch the fluff, get to the point.

## Template

The landing page is rendered with `/source/layouts/landing.erb`. If you would like to modify your landing page design, please create a new layout file and copy the content.

The landing page has no navigation header. If you want a page that looks similar to the landing page yet has a navigation menu, then use the `product.erb` template.

## Config

The landing page is configured by editing the frontmatter at the top of the markdown file, between the three dashes. The frontmatter uses the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format. The Landing Page has the following parameters to set: 

### Parameters 

Parameter | Description | Example 
----------|-------------|--------
`title` | The page title. | *Bambora Developer Portal* 
`layout` | The page layout. Must be 'landing'. | *landing* 
`hero_unit` | Defines the contents of the hero unit at the top of the page | See below 
`card_sets` | A **list** of Card Sets to be displayed. | See below

### The Hero Unit

The `hero_unit` makes up the large block of content at the top of the landing page. It has a page heading, a tagline, and, optionally, a link and/or a background image. 

#### Hero Unit Parameters

Parameter | Description | Example Value 
----------|-------------|--------------
`big_heading` | The large page header. | *Build it with Bambora.* |
`tag_line` | Smaller text below the `big_heading`. | *Start acecepting payments today...* 
`hero_image` | A background image for the Hero Unit (optional). | *shoal-1.png* 
`button` | A button object below the `tag_line` (optional). | See below

##### Button Parameters

Parameter | Description | Example Value 
----------|-------------|--------------
`text` | The text value  of the button | *Get Started*
`link` | The link destination of the button | */portal/quickstart.html* 

The style of the landing page will change depending on if a `hero_image:` has been specified. The image should be located in the `/source/images/` folder and large enough to work as a background image on all screen sizes. The image should be dark enough that white text will be visible on top of it. 

### The Card Sets list

The `card_sets` list makes up the second part of the landing page. Each Card Set in the list has a title, description, and list of cards associated with that set. 

#### Card Set Parameters 

Parameter | Description | Example Value 
----------|-------------|--------------
`title` | Heading for the Card Set | *Upcoming Events.*
`description` | Description below the `title`. | *Comming soon at Bambora...* 
`cards` | A **list** of cards in the Card Set | See Below

#### Cards

`cards` contains a list of Cards to be displayed in the card set. A Card is a descriptive link to another page in the portal. A Card has three required parameters and one optional one. 

##### Card parameters

Parameter | Description | Example Value
----------|-------------|--------
`link` | The destination link of the card. | */portal/quickstart.html*
`title` | The heading of the card. | *Try our API* 
`description` | The body of the card. | *Get up and running in minutes...*
`icon` | The name of a [Bambora UI](https://bambora.github.io/ui.bambora.com/#icons) icon. | *checkmark*  
`tag` | A tag for the card (optional). | *New*
