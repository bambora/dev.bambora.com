# Product Pages

A Product Page is a mix between documentation and flash. It should look nice yet provide a clear avenue to the important documentation. Use the cards in the layout to direct users to the most important information.

There should always be a Quickstart card.

## Template

The product page is rendered with `/source/layouts/product.erb`. If you would like to modify the product page design, please create a new layout file and copy the content.

Unlike the Landing Page, the Product Page has a left-hand navigation menu.

## Config

 The product page is configured by editing the frontmatter at the top of the markdown file, between the 3 dashes. The frontmatter uses the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format. The Product Page has the following parameters to set. 

### Parameters

Parameter | Description | Example
----------|-------------|--------
`title` | The page title. | *Android* 
`layout` | The page layout. Must be 'product'. | *product* 
`nav` | What nav menu to use, located in /data.| *nav.yaml*
`name` | File name and path used for the nav menu. | */apac/ihpp*
`parent` | Parent entry in the nav menu. | */apac/payments*
`cards` | A **list** of Cards to be displayed. | See below

### Cards 

`cards` contains a list of Cards to be displayed on the Product Page. A Card is a descriptive link to another page in the portal. A Card has three required parameters and one optional one. All the Cards for a product page are put into a list in `cards`.

#### Card parameters

Parameter | Description | Example Value
----------|-------------|--------
`link` | The destination link of the card. | */portal/quickstart.html*
`title` | The heading of the card. | *Try our API*
`description` | The body of the card. | *Get up and running in minutes...*
`icon` | The name of a [Bambora UI](https://bambora.github.io/ui.bambora.com/#icons) icon. | *checkmark*  
`tag` | A tag for the card (optional). | *New*
