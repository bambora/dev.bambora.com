# Writing Tutorials

This describes how to write tutorials.

## Context

Tutorials are context-based. They should be specific and not try to cover too much.

## Brevity

Keep it straight to the point. Save the extreme details and options to the API and product spec pages.

## Steps

Make the tutorial a sequence of steps.

You can configure the step numbers to appear in the table of contents.

## Including Images

We've made it easy for anyone to update the documentation. So if you see any docs in error or sections that could use improvement simply look for the **Update Docs** link at the top of every page. It will send you to the GitHub page where you can make the change.

## Color

Must be purple.

## Size

Shouldn't be too large, nor too small.

## Templates

Running into issues? No problem, just send us an email to [support@bambora.com](mailto:support@bambora.com).

## Review and Publishing

What you need to do to get your tutorial reviewed and published.
