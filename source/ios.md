# iOS SDK

This section of the guide will walk you through how to take payments in your iOS project.


**Language and Requirements**

The iOS Native Payment SDK is written in Objective-C.

If you're interested in using `Native Payment` in a Swift-based app, please see [iOS Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html) for details on how to use Objective-C and Swift together.

**Minimum deployment target:** iOS 8.0
